# 📈 Dexscreener Scraper 📊

A Python tool for extracting real-time trading data from Dexscreener (dexscreener.com) via WebSocket ⚡ and HTTP requests 🌐.

## Description 📝

This project provides a Flask based Python script 🐍 designed to automate the retrieval of live trading data from Dexscreener. It utilizes both WebSocket connections 🔌 for real-time updates and HTTP requests 📡 for static data, enabling users to efficiently monitor 👁️ and analyze decentralized exchange (DEX) activity. 

## Features ✨

* **Real-time WebSocket Data 🚀:** Captures live price updates 💰, volume changes 📈, and other dynamic data directly from Dexscreener's WebSocket feed.
* **HTTP Data Retrieval 📦:** Fetches static data, such as token information ℹ️ and historical data 🕰️, using dexscreener official api.
* **Modular Design 🧩:** Filters can be added as desired 🛠️, allowing users to customize data retrieval and processing.
* **Data Parsing and Formatting 📄:** Parses the raw data from Dexscreener into a structured format (e.g., JSON) for easy use in other applications.
* **Error Handling 🛡️:** Implements robust error handling to ensure stable and reliable data retrieval.

## Installation 🛠️

1.  **Clone the repository 📥:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/doffn/Dexscreen-scraper.git
    cd Dexscreener-scraper
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies 📦:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage 🚀

1.  **Run the scraper 🏃:**

    ```bash
    python -m flask run
    ```

2.  **Configuration (Optional) ⚙️:**
    * Modify the `Filter` to customize the scraping parameters, such as target trading pairs 🎯, data output 📄, and WebSocket connection settings 🔌.
    * You may need to inspect the Dexscreener website 🌐 to identify the correct trading filter identifiers.

## Example Output 📊

The script outputs data in JSON format 📄 to the console or as specified in the configuration. Example:
